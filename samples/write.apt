minver 1
- Set the minimum version to version 1
- This is not required but can help to ensure that your script requires a specific version under the hood.

- Write Hello World to the screen, effectively completing the canonical Hello World
writeln "Hello World!"
- Write Hello World without a new line at the end
write "Hello World"

- To see that it worked, let's write out something else. You'll notice that
- this follows on quite neatly from the last Hello World. This also showcases
- the d/m/y format and variable substitutions more broadly.
write ". \nI see that you're quite spherical today (#b_date_dmy) there World."
