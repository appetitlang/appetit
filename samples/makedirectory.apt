- In this script, we are going to create a directory. This is not a
- particularly complicated script as the makedirectory statement only takes
- one value: the diretctory to create.

set dir = "test"

- Let's notify the user that we are making a directory in their home
writeln "Making a directory called \"#dir\" in #b_home"
- And then let's make that directory
makedirectory "#b_home/#dir"
