minver 1
- This script showcases how to write a script with a variable.
- First, we'll set the minver as is convention but not required

- Next, we'll set up a variable
set greeting = "Hello World!"

- Finally, we'll write it to the screen. Notice here that the writeln statement
- gets access to the variable by including the variable name prepended with a
- # symbol.
writeln "Greeting: #greeting"
